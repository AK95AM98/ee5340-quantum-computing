## How to Use This Textbook

Chapters are ordered to respect concept dependencies — each chapter builds on material from previous chapters. Students should work through chapters sequentially, as later topics assume mastery of earlier material. The mathematical foundations in Chapter 1 are referenced throughout the entire textbook.
