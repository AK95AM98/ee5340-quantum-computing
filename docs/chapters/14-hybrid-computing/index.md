# Quantum-Classical Hybrid Computing

## Summary

This chapter covers hybrid quantum-classical algorithms designed for near-term quantum devices. We develop the variational principle and derive the VQE algorithm including ansatz design and classical parameter optimization, present QAOA with performance guarantees, analyze barren plateau phenomena, discuss NISQ-era constraints, and introduce quantum error mitigation techniques including zero-noise extrapolation.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 10 concepts:

1. Variational Principle
2. Variational Quantum Eigensolver
3. QAOA Algorithm
4. Parameterized Quantum Circuit
5. Classical Optimizer Loop
6. Barren Plateaus
7. NISQ Era Constraints
8. Quantum Error Mitigation
9. Zero-Noise Extrapolation
10. Measurement Overhead

## Prerequisites
