# Stochastic Computing

## Summary

This chapter introduces the stochastic computing paradigm as an alternative approach to deterministic digital computation. We develop stochastic number representations in both unipolar and bipolar encoding, analyze stochastic logic gates for multiplication and addition, derive variance bounds on accuracy, examine correlation effects and decorrelation techniques, and explore applications in image processing and neural networks.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 10 concepts:

1. Stochastic Number Encoding
2. Stochastic Bit Stream
3. Stochastic Multiplication
4. Stochastic Addition
5. Mux-Based Stochastic Logic
6. Variance In Stochastic Systems
7. Correlation Effects
8. Decorrelation Techniques
9. Stochastic Error Tolerance
10. Stochastic Image Processing

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 1: Mathematical Foundations](../01-mathematical-foundations/index.md)
- [Chapter 4: Classical Computing Fundamentals](../04-classical-computing/index.md)
