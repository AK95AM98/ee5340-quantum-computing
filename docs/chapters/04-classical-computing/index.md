# Classical Computing Fundamentals

## Summary

This chapter covers the foundations of classical digital computing from Boolean algebra through CMOS transistor physics and power dissipation analysis. We derive the dynamic and static power models, examine subthreshold and gate oxide leakage mechanisms, analyze the Boltzmann tyranny limiting voltage scaling, and introduce computational complexity theory and the Church-Turing thesis.
