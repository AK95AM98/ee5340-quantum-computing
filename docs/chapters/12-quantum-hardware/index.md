# Quantum Hardware Platforms

## Summary

This chapter surveys the major physical platforms for building quantum computers. We derive the Josephson junction Hamiltonian and analyze the transmon qubit in the high EJ/EC regime, develop the trapped ion Paul trap equations of motion and Rabi oscillation dynamics, present the Molmer-Sorensen entangling gate, introduce photonic quantum computing through the KLM scheme, and compare coherence times, gate fidelities, and connectivity across platforms.
