# Physical Limits of Computing

## Summary

This chapter explores the fundamental physical constraints on computation. Starting from thermodynamic entropy and the Boltzmann constant, we derive Landauer's principle and its minimum energy bound. We examine Maxwell's demon through Szilard's engine, trace the history of Moore's Law and Dennard scaling to their limits, and establish ultimate computational speed bounds via the Margolus-Levitin theorem, Bremermann's limit, and the Bekenstein bound.
