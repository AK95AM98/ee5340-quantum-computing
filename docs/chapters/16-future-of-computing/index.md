# Future of Computing

## Summary

This chapter assesses the current state and future directions of computing paradigms. We analyze quantum supremacy experiments and their complexity-theoretic arguments, distinguish quantum supremacy from practical quantum advantage, examine benchmarking metrics including cross-entropy benchmarking and quantum volume, discuss quantum resource estimation for fault-tolerant applications, and survey the post-Moore computing landscape.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 6 concepts:

1. Quantum Supremacy Experiment
2. Quantum Advantage
3. Cross-Entropy Benchmarking
4. Quantum Volume
5. Quantum Resource Estimation
6. Post-Moore Landscape
