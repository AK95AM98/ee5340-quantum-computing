# Information Theory Foundations

## Summary

This chapter develops Shannon's information theory framework with rigorous mathematical derivations. Topics include Shannon entropy and its properties, joint and conditional entropy, mutual information, the data processing inequality, source and channel coding theorems, and channel capacity. We also introduce Kolmogorov complexity and algorithmic randomness, and establish the deep connections between information-theoretic and thermodynamic entropy.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 13 concepts:

1. Shannon Entropy
2. Joint Entropy
3. Conditional Entropy
4. Mutual Information
5. Relative Entropy
6. Data Processing Inequality
7. Source Coding Theorem
8. Channel Capacity
9. Noisy Channel Coding Theorem
10. Binary Symmetric Channel
11. Kolmogorov Complexity
12. Algorithmic Randomness
13. Hamming Distance

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 1: Mathematical Foundations](../01-mathematical-foundations/index.md)
- [Chapter 4: Classical Computing Fundamentals](../04-classical-computing/index.md) (for Kolmogorov Complexity)
