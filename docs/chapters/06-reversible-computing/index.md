# Reversible Computing

## Summary

This chapter develops the theory and practice of reversible computation. We distinguish logical from physical reversibility, present Bennett's proof that all computation can be made reversible, derive the matrix representations of the Toffoli and Fredkin gates, analyze adiabatic computing circuits and energy recovery logic, and discuss the management of garbage bits in reversible instruction sets.

1. Logical Reversibility
2. Physical Reversibility
3. Bennett's Proof
4. Toffoli Gate
5. Fredkin Gate
6. Controlled-SWAP Operation
7. Adiabatic Computing
8. Energy Recovery Logic
9. Reversible Instruction Set
10. Garbage Bits

## Prerequisites
