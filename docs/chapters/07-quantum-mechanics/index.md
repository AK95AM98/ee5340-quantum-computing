# Quantum Mechanics Foundations

## Summary

This chapter establishes the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics needed for quantum computing. We present the postulates of quantum mechanics, develop Dirac notation and Hilbert space formalism, derive the Born rule for measurement probabilities, prove the uncertainty principle from commutation relations, introduce density matrices for mixed states, derive the Schrodinger equation and time evolution operator, and prove the no-cloning theorem.
