This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## Project Overview

An MkDocs Material site for the UMN EE 5340 course: Introduction to Quantum Computing and Physical Basics of Computing. This is an intelligent textbook covering physical limits of computing, information theory, beyond-CMOS devices, reversible computing, quantum computing, and stochastic computing.

## Build Commands

```bash
mkdocs serve        # Local dev server with live reload (http://127.0.0.1:8000)
mkdocs build        # Build static site to site/ directory
mkdocs gh-deploy    # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## Architecture

- **mkdocs.yml** - Site configuration, navigation structure, theme settings, and markdown extensions
- **docs/** - All source content (Markdown)
  - **docs/index.md** - Site homepage
  - **docs/course-description.md** - Full course description with Bloom's Taxonomy outcomes
  - **docs/chapters/** - Course chapter content
  - **docs/learning-graph/** - Concept dependencies and learning graph data
  - **docs/sims/** - Interactive MicroSims
  - **docs/prompts/** - LLM prompts used to generate content
- **site/** - Built output (generated by `mkdocs build`, gitignored)

## Content Conventions

- Chapters use LaTeX math via MathJax (`$$...$$` for display, `$...$` for inline) with Dirac bra-ket notation for quantum states
- Navigation order is defined in `mkdocs.yml` under the `nav:` key
- The site uses `pymdownx.arithmatex` for math rendering, `admonition` for callouts, and `pymdownx.superfences` for fenced code blocks
